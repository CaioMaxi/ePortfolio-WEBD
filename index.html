            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my ePortfolio! This is a space where I document my learning journey, share the skills I’m developing, and celebrate the certifications I achieve. I’m committed to continuously updating this platform as I grow professionally and explore new opportunities.</p>
            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am a young professional with a deep passion for gaming, competitions, and hockey—activities that inspire my creativity and fuel my competitive spirit. Born and raised in Brazil, my journey has taken me across continents in pursuit of growth and new opportunities. In Australia, I immersed myself in learning English and earned qualifications in business administration, embracing the challenge of adapting to a new culture and language.</p>
            <p>Now, I call Halifax, located on Canada's picturesque east coast, my home. Here, I completed a diploma in Accounting, honing my analytical skills and developing a strong foundation in finance. Currently, I am expanding my expertise by enrolling in the IT Programming program at NSCC, where I am exploring my interest in technology and coding.</p>
            <p>Through my experiences, I have developed a global perspective, adaptability, and an eagerness to embrace challenges. These qualities shape my professional aspirations and personal outlook, driving me to achieve excellence in everything I pursue.</p>
